This repository contains the codebase for our ACL 2025 ClimateNLP Workshop paper:

**LLM-Driven Estimation of Personal Carbon Footprint from Dialogues**  
*Shuqin Li, Huifang Du, Haofen Wang*

We propose **Chat2Footprint**, an LLM-powered system for estimating personal carbon footprint (PCF) from natural language dialogues. The system combines conversational understanding with emission knowledge grounding to deliver accurate, context-aware PCF estimations.

üîç **Key Contributions**:
- Introduce **CarbonDialog-1K**, a benchmark dataset with 1,028 annotated user activity dialogues.
- Develop the **PCCT** framework, leveraging LLMs for activity tracking and emission factor inference.

üì¶ **Dataset Availability**:  
*The CarbonDialog-1K dataset will be released soon. Stay tuned!*
